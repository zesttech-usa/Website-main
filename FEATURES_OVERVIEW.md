# Zest Technologies LLC: Website & Portal Features Overview

Welcome to the new Zest Technologies corporate website and integrated job portal! This document provides an overview of the features and capabilities we have built into the platform, designed to provide a premium experience for both your clients and job candidates.

---

## 🎨 1. Premium Brand Experience
The public-facing website is engineered to establish trust and showcase Zest Technologies as a high-end IT staffing and solutions provider.
*   **Modern Aesthetics & Animations:** The site features fluid animations, premium typography, and glass-like UI elements to create an engaging "wow" factor.
*   **Fully Responsive:** The layout perfectly adapts to any screen size—whether a candidate is applying from their smartphone or a corporate client is reviewing your services on a desktop.
*   **Light & Dark Modes:** Users can seamlessly toggle between a bright, clean light theme and a sleek, modern dark theme that respects their device preferences.
*   **Dynamic Sections:** Engaging components like the "Why Choose Us" sliding marquee and interactive service cards keep visitors engaged as they scroll.

## 💼 2. Interactive Job Board (Careers Page)
We built a dedicated, lightning-fast job portal directly into your website so candidates don't have to leave your domain to find opportunities.
*   **Live Listings:** A beautifully styled grid displaying all your active opportunities.
*   **Smart Search & Filtering:** Candidates can instantly type to search by job title or department, or use the dropdown to filter by employment type (Full-time, Contract, Freelance, etc.).
*   **Sorting Capabilities:** Jobs can be sorted by "Newest" or "Oldest" to help candidates find the latest roles.
*   **At-a-Glance Information:** Every job card immediately shows the candidate the most important details: Department, Location, Experience Level, Job Type, and Salary (with global currency support like $, ₹, €, £).

## 📥 3. Frictionless Candidate Applications
When a candidate finds a role they love, applying is incredibly simple and highly secure.
*   **Instant Application Form:** Candidates can apply directly on the job’s detail page by providing their name, email, and phone number.
*   **Resume Uploads:** A drag-and-drop secure file uploader accepts PDF and DOCX files (up to 5MB).
*   **Direct-to-Inbox Delivery (Maximum Privacy):** To protect candidate privacy and simplify your workflow, resumes are **never saved to a public server**. The moment a candidate hits "Submit," the system securely packages their details and resume and emails it directly to your designated HR inbox.

## 🔐 4. Secure Admin Processing Portal
You have full control over your job board without needing to know a single line of code. We built a shadow portal just for your HR/Admin team.
*   **Password Protected:** Your dedicated `/zest-admin` page is locked behind a secure master password.
*   **One-Page Job Publisher:** A dead-simple form where your team can type in a job title, salary, location, and description. You can even use basic formatting (like bullet points) for the description!
*   **One-Click Publishing:** Clicking publish instantly updates the live public website. No waiting on developers to post new jobs.
*   **Active Jobs Management:** The admin dashboard shows a real-time list of every job currently live on the site.
*   **Instant Deletion:** Filled a role? Click the red "Delete" button next to any active job, and it is instantly eradicated from the live website.

## ⚡ 5. "Zero Maintenance" Infrastructure
Perhaps the best feature is the one you can't see.

Traditional job boards require expensive databases, constant security patching, and complex hosting to keep candidate data safe. We bypassed all of that.
*   Everything is powered by secure "Serverless Functions."
*   There is no physical database to hack and no server to maintain. 
*   When you publish or delete a job, the site essentially rebuilds itself and pushes the update directly to the global network. It is incredibly fast, extremely secure, and costs a fraction of what traditional hosting requires.
